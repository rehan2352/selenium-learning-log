Day 12 – Handle Authenticated Popup

Description:
This project shows how to handle Basic Authentication popups in Selenium WebDriver using Java.
Instead of entering username and password manually in the popup, we pass them directly in the URL.

Syntax:
http://username:password@URL

Example in this project:
http://admin:admin@the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth

Steps to Run:
1. Install Java and Selenium WebDriver.
2. Download ChromeDriver and set the path.
3. Create a Java project and add the code.
4. Run the program – it will directly log in without showing the popup.

Technologies Used:
- Java
- Selenium WebDriver
- ChromeDriver
