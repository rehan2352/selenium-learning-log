# Day 4 - XPath Axes in Selenium

In this session, we explored different **XPath Axes** used for locating elements in complex HTML DOMs using Selenium WebDriver.

## âœ… Covered XPath Axes:

1. **self::**  
   Selects the current node.

2. **parent::**  
   Selects the direct parent of the current node.

3. **child::**  
   Selects all direct child nodes of the current node.

4. **ancestor::**  
   Selects all ancestors (parent, grandparent, etc.) of the current node.

5. **descendant::**  
   Selects all descendants (children, grandchildren, etc.) of the current node.

6. **following::**  
   Selects everything in the document after the closing tag of the current node.

7. **following-sibling::**  
   Selects all siblings after the current node.

8. **preceding::**  
   Selects all nodes that appear before the current node.
